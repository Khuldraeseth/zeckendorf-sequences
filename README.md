# Inspiration
Annie asked me to help her develop an algorithm to generate Simple Zeckendorf Sequences in 2 dimensions. The definition for such sequences can be found in a mathematical paper from Williams College titled [Gaussian Behavior In Zeckendorf Decompositions From Lattices](https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/sjmiller/public_html/math/papers/Zeckendorf2DComboDecompv70.pdf "math paper") by Chen et al.
